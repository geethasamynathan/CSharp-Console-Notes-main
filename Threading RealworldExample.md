# What is a Thread?
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Each thread has its own stack and local variables. In C#, the main thread is the one that executes the Main method. However, you can create additional threads to run tasks in parallel.



# Task

In the world of software development, responsiveness, and performance are key factors for delivering high-quality applications. Asynchronous programming in C# provides a powerful mechanism to achieve these goals by allowing developers to write code that executes concurrently without blocking the main thread.


Understanding Asynchronous Programming: Traditional synchronous programming follows a sequential execution model, where each operation blocks the program’s execution until it completes. This approach works well for simple scenarios but can lead to performance issues when dealing with time-consuming tasks, such as network requests or database operations. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, enables you to write code that doesn’t wait for each operation to finish before moving on to the next, thus improving responsiveness and overall performance.


```cs
using System.Net;

string[] urls = {
            "https://unsplash.com/photos/little-kids-at-a-halloween-party-L63LrojR6r8",
            "https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-mushrooms-sitting-on-top-of-a-lush-green-field-g9EfIYnyFgQ",

        };

string[] destinations = {
            @"D:\Destinations\file1.jpg",
            @"D:\Destinations\file2.jpg",
            @"D:\Destinations\file3.jpg"
        };

Thread[] threads = new Thread[urls.Length];

for (int i = 0; i < urls.Length; i++)
{
    int index = i; // Capture the loop variable
    threads[i] = new Thread(() => DownloadFile(urls[index], destinations[index]));
    threads[i].Start();
}

// Wait for all threads to complete
foreach (Thread thread in threads)
{
    thread.Join();
}

Console.WriteLine("All files downloaded.");

// Keep the console window open
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
Console.ReadKey();
    

  static void DownloadFile(string url, string destination)
{
    using (WebClient client = new WebClient())
    {
        client.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3");
        client.DownloadFile(url, destination);
        Console.WriteLine($"Downloaded {url} to {destination}");
    }
}

# Task
The Task class in C# is a fundamental part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and is used to represent an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to run code concurrently, making it easier to write efficient and responsive applications.

# Key Concepts
**Task Class:** Represents an asynchronous operation.

**Task<T> Class:** Represents an asynchronous operation that can return a value.

**Async and Await:** Keywords used to write asynchronous code more easily.

# Creating and Running a Task
Here’s a simple example of creating and running a task:
```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Task task = new Task(() => {
            Console.WriteLine("Task is running...");
            Task.Delay(2000).Wait(); // Simulate work
            Console.WriteLine("Task completed.");
        });

        task.Start();
        task.Wait(); // Wait for the task to complete

        Console.WriteLine("Main method completed.");
    }
}

```
# Using Task.Run
```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Task task = Task.Run(() => {
            Console.WriteLine("Task is running...");
            Task.Delay(2000).Wait(); // Simulate work
            Console.WriteLine("Task completed.");
        });

        task.Wait(); // Wait for the task to complete

        Console.WriteLine("Main method completed.");
    }
}
```
# Returning a Value from a Task
To return a value from a task, use Task<T>:
```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Task<int> task = Task.Run(() => {
            Console.WriteLine("Task is running...");
            Task.Delay(2000).Wait(); // Simulate work
            Console.WriteLine("Task completed.");
            return 42; // Return a value
        });

        int result = task.Result; // Wait for the task to complete and get the result
        Console.WriteLine($"Task result: {result}");

        Console.WriteLine("Main method completed.");
    }
}

```
# Using async and await
The async and await keywords make it easier to work with tasks by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
```cs
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        string url = "https://example.com";
        string content = await DownloadContentAsync(url);
        Console.WriteLine(content.Substring(0, 100)); // Display first 100 characters

        Console.WriteLine("Main method completed.");
    }

    public static async Task<string> DownloadContentAsync(string url)
    {
        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            string content = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
            return content;
        }
    }
}
```
# Handling Exceptions
You can handle exceptions in tasks using try-catch blocks:
```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            await Task.Run(() => {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("An error occurred.");
            });
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught: {ex.Message}");
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Main method completed.");
    }
}

```

# Example 1:


# Example 2: Using async and await
```cs 
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        int[] data = new int[1000000];
        Random rand = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            data[i] = rand.Next(1, 100);
        }

        int numberOfTasks = 4;
        Task[] tasks = new Task[numberOfTasks];
        int chunkSize = data.Length / numberOfTasks;

        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTasks; i++)
        {
            int start = i * chunkSize;
            int end = (i == numberOfTasks - 1) ? data.Length : start + chunkSize;
            tasks[i] = ProcessDataAsync(data, start, end);
        }

        // Wait for all tasks to complete
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

        Console.WriteLine("Data processing completed.");
    }

    public static async Task ProcessDataAsync(int[] data, int start, int end)
    {
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
            {
                // Simulate data processing
                data[i] = data[i] * 2;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"Processed data from index {start} to {end}");
        });
    }
}
```
